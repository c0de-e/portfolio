      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I began programming in 2015 when my high school introduced a computer
        science class for the first time. Eager for a challenge, I enrolled in
        the Advanced Placement course, even though it was my first exposure to
        computers. The class focused on Java, which I initially struggled with
        but found fascinating. This experience shaped my future path in college.
        Four years later, I earned a B.S. in Game Design Engineering from the
        University of Silicon Valley in San Jose, California.

        Today, I am a Software Engineer with nearly 5 years of experience in
        creating websites, add-ins, and tools. My professional work includes
        developing a game, building 3 full-stack websites, and crafting numerous
        tools and add-ins. In my previous role, I was responsible for overseeing
        the technical aspects of projects, including software architecture,
        development, and deployment. Working in a small, dynamic team, I adapted
        to constant changes and gained valuable experience along the way.
