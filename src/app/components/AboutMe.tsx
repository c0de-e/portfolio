      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I am a Software Engineer with over 6 years of experience architecting distributed systems and full-stack solutions. Since starting my coding journey
        in 2015 and graduating from the University of Silicon Valley, I have focused on building high-performance software using C#, Python, Node.js, and React.

      <p>
        My professional work includes migrating legacy monoliths to serverless microservices on Google Cloud Platform, designing reliable webhook
        systems, and automating complex workflows with custom tools. In previous roles, I owned the technical execution of projects, managing everything
        from system architecture and database design to automated deployments. I am passionate about engineering resilience and efficiency into every
        product I build.
