      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I first started programming back in 2015 when my high school offered a
        computer science class for the first time. Intrigued, I took the AP
        version of the class, as I am always up for a challenge. This was also
        an introduction to computers for me. The class used Java and I was not
        so great at it, but I found it very interesting and it gave me a path
        forward for college.

        Fast forward and I am now a Software Engineer with almost 5 years of
        experience creating websites, add-ins, and tools. I have professionaly
        created a game, 3 full stack sites, and numerous tools and add-ins. In
        my previous position, I took charge of the technical aspects including
        architecting, building, and deplyoing software and tools. The team was
        very small and things were constantly changing, but I adapted well and
        learned a lot in the process.
